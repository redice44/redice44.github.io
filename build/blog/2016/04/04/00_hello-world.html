<h3 id="april-4th-2016">April 4th, 2016</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve finally decided to start a development blog. First though, a little bit about myself. I have been an on and off enthusiast/hobbyist programmer for many years, but have been recently focusing on web applications with a JavaScript focus in the past nine months. </p>
<p>Most posts will be completely focused on a single project with plans, issues, progress, and accomplishments. There may be stand alone posts that discuss specific topics in greater detail. I have also dabbled in the idea of various tutorial series, mostly on topics or knowledge gaps that I myself struggled with. I am also more than just a programmer, so there may be non-development related posts here and there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My primary goal is this will help me keep organized, focused, and moving forward, while having a secondary goal of being a positive contributer to the developer ecosystem. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<h5 id="personal-website">Personal Website</h5>
<p>This project is my current focus.</p>
<p>This will be quite the work in progress. I definitely want it to be a strong, positive reflection of myself where I can host this blog, various webapps that I am working on or have finished, as well as, a medium for professional development. </p>
<h5 id="chess-game">Chess Game</h5>
<p>I have been working on a Chess game for a week or two before starting on this website. Going through a few refactors of the game made me want to start documenting the process. From there I decided, &quot;let&#39;s go for it&quot;, and started on the, long overdue, journey to make my own website. </p>
<p>I have a functioning game working, but I decided to rebuild the game because of a handful of reasons. More on this later.</p>
<h5 id="floating-ideas">Floating Ideas</h5>
<p>There are a few future ideas that I have floating around that I may or may not pursue as time permits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Little hockey website for my local pickup group</li>
<li>A custom t-shirt website rebuild  </li>
<li>A cooking tutorial site</li>
<li>A heavy systems based game - Lots of ideas</li>
<li>Twitch multi-stream syncing. Similar to multitwitch, but for streams that are showing the same content but from different points of view.</li>
</ul>
<p>A fun note. Many of these initial posts will be written long before they are ever published. The reason for this is I will be building a lot of things from the &quot;ground up&quot;. I feel that the process of doing so reinforces the learning experience far better. </p>
