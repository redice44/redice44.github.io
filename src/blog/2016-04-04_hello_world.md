# Hello World - An unoriginal beginning

### April 4th, 2016

I've finally decided to start a development blog. First though, a little bit about myself. I have been an on and off enthusiast/hobbyist programmer for many years, but have been recently focusing on web applications with a JavaScript focus in the past nine months. 

Most posts will be completely focused on a single project with plans, issues, progress, and accomplishments. There may be stand alone posts that discuss specific topics in greater detail. I have also dabbled in the idea of various tutorial series, mostly on topics or knowledge gaps that I myself struggled with. I am also more than just a programmer, so there may be non-development related posts here and there.

> My primary goal is this will help me keep organized, focused, and moving forward, while having a secondary goal of being a positive contributer to the developer ecosystem. 

### Projects

##### Personal Website

This project is my current focus.

This will be quite the work in progress. I definitely want it to be a strong, positive reflection of myself where I can host this blog, various webapps that I am working on or have finished, as well as, a medium for professional development. 

##### Chess Game

I have been working on a Chess game for a week or two before starting on this website. Going through a few refactors of the game made me want to start documenting the process. From there I decided, "let's go for it", and started on the, long overdue, journey to make my own website. 

I have a functioning game working, but I decided to rebuild the game because of a handful of reasons. More on this later.

##### Floating Ideas

There are a few future ideas that I have floating around that I may or may not pursue as time permits.
- Little hockey website for my local pickup group
- A custom t-shirt website rebuild  
- A cooking tutorial site
- A heavy systems based game - Lots of ideas
- Twitch multi-stream syncing. Similar to multitwitch, but for streams that are showing the same content but from different points of view.

A fun note. Many of these initial posts will be written long before they are ever published. The reason for this is I will be building a lot of things from the "ground up". I feel that the process of doing so reinforces the learning experience far better.
