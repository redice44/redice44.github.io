# Setting up the Website

While planning the blog portion of my site, I quickly came to the realization that if I wanted to code my own blogging platform (which I do) then it will be quite a time investment. In the spirit of blogging that kind of delay wasn't appealing to me. So, I began thinking of some quick and dirty short term solutions. 

### Initial Ideas and Thoughts

##### Markdown

I originally began writing these posts in markdown, specifically GitHub's flavor of markdown. I started to poke around and see what kind of work process would be required in order to turn these around into a few simple pages. I know that (Jekyll)[https://jekyllrb.com/] is around and integrates nicely into GitHub's Pages, but as with many things for this website and other projects, I wanted to go through the experience of developing the tools that I use for the experience of developing finished products.
